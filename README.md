## üöÄ The Vision

Complete Solution (formerly EduLens GPT) aims to make personalized, accessible tutoring available to every student. The app allows students to scan their real textbooks and handwritten notebooks, and then uses AI to explain concepts, solve problems, and create study aids‚Äîall in their preferred language (like Hinglish) and tailored to their specific syllabus.
