2. Objectives and Success Criteria 

Primary Goals: 

Enable personalized, accessible tutoring directly from students’ real textbooks and notebooks. 

Measurable Success Indicators: 

Ability of users to scan and get accurate, understandable explanations in Hinglish and other languages. 

User engagement and satisfaction measured by app usage frequency and positive feedback. 

Support for syllabus customization—accurate recognition of class, subject, and school-specific material. 

Effectiveness of AI in explaining concepts, solving exercises, and creating study aids (flashcards, quizzes). 

Seamless switching between app modes and reliable OCR for multi-page scans. 

Retention of scanned chapters for repeated use without rescanning. 

3. Key Features and Requirements 

Scan-to-Study Functionality: 

Use the phone camera to live-scan textbook pages or handwritten homework. The app extracts text in real time with OCR, interprets content via GPT models, and teaches from the scanned material. 

Multi-Mode AI Personalities: 

Chat Mode: 

Casual, friendly interaction in Hinglish, resembling conversation with a grandmother or friend. 

Study Mode: 

Detailed class-wise explanation of subjects. 

Exam Mode: 

Strict, exam-focused mode that uses syllabus and book data to provide Q&A practice. 

Coding Mode: 

Helps solve coding challenges, explains code snippets, and provides programming examples. 

Multilingual Support: 

The app detects user input language, defaulting to Hinglish if typed, but also supporting Hindi, English, Tamil, Bengali, French, and more, responding in the user's preferred language. 

School and Syllabus Customization: 

Users select or input their class (6–12), subject (Science, Maths, English, SST, etc.), school name (e.g., Kendriya Vidyalaya), and syllabus type (NCERT, State board, or scanned content). This tailoring ensures content relevance and accuracy. 

AI-Powered Content Interaction: 

Explain topics simply, summarize paragraphs or chapters, solve exercises (short/long questions, MCQs), teach definitions and diagrams, and generate flashcards and quizzes for effective learning. 

Convenience Features: 

Save scanned chapters for future study; ask questions based on scanned texts; view chat history for past interactions; optional voice input and output to facilitate hands-free study. 

User Scenarios: 

A student scans their Science textbook chapter and uses the Study Mode to clarify concepts presented in their native Hinglish. 

Another student preparing for exams switches to Exam Mode to practice NCERT questions sourced from their scanned book pages with strict tutoring feedback. 

A curious learner chats casually in Chat Mode to deepen understanding or troubleshoot homework problems through friendly guidance. 

4. Constraints and Assumptions 

The app is currently designed for Android mobile devices only, prioritizing accessibility for the target age group. 

The accuracy of OCR depends on image quality and handwriting legibility. 

Assumes stable internet connectivity for real-time AI processing via GPT APIs. 

The app’s effectiveness depends on proper syllabus and school data input by users for personalized experience. 

Voice input and output features are optional and may require additional device permissions and hardware support. 

5. Dependencies and Stakeholders 

Dependencies: 

Integration with GPT-3.5/4 API for AI processing and response generation. 

OCR technology for live text extraction from images. 

Android development environment (MIT App Inventor for quick prototyping or Android Studio for full-featured deployment). 

Stakeholders: 

Product Manager: Oversees vision, roadmap, and alignment with user needs. 

Development Team: Handles app builds, AI integration, OCR implementation, and UI design. 

Content Experts/Educators: Validate subject explanations and mode interactions. 

End Users (Students): Direct beneficiaries providing feedback for improvements.
